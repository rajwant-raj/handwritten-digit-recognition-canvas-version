# 🧠 Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN (Enhanced Canvas Version)

An upgraded version of the Handwritten Digit Recognition project (handwritten digit predictor) that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset to identify handwritten digits (0–9).
This new version introduces an interactive drawing canvas, allowing users to draw digits directly instead of uploading images.

Built with TensorFlow, Streamlit, and Streamlit-Draw-Canvas for a smooth real-time experience.



## ✨ What’s New in This Version

🖊️ Draw Instead of Uploading:
Users can now draw digits directly on a canvas using their mouse or touch input.

⚡ Instant Prediction:
As soon as the digit is drawn, the app processes it through the CNN model and shows the prediction with confidence levels.

🎨 Improved User Experience:
Simplified interface for quick testing, better suited for demonstrations or real-time recognition.

🔗 Linked to Previous Version:
This project is an enhanced version of the Handwritten Digit Recognition (Image Upload Version)
.
It reuses the same trained model (my_model.keras) but introduces a new Streamlit interface for interactive drawing.
